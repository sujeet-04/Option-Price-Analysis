# Option-Price-Analysis
At present, different options contracts resulting from different taxes, different exchanges and different contract standards can have completely different trading fee rules. Transaction cost is an important factor affecting the option price. In this paper, i will discuss the transaction costs in two parts: in the first part, the assumptions of the original BS model would be a verified and adjusted option pricing model with transaction costs established. Then, some further issues about transaction costs shall be discussed. In the second part, instances of my applied adjusted model will be given and analysed. Then, the volatility and real-world example combined with Greek letters is further considered.
